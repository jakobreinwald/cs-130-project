## Installing

To install dependencies, navigate to ./minuet and run `npm install`.  
Then, navigate to ./server and run `npm install`.  

This assures that both dependencies are installed for the server and frontend.

## Building

To build the app, navigate to ./minuet and run `npm run build`. The final production build will be in ./minuet/build.

## Deploying

To deploy the app, use the final production build found in ./minuet/build. The server.js file in ./server also needs to be deployed.  

Optionally, use our CD pipeline to automatically deploy the app to any of our preset URLS.
